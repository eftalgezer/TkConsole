# Font and Colors

TkConsole allows you to customize the font and colors of the console widget to match the look and feel of your application. You can configure these settings when creating an instance of the `Console` class.

## Font

The `font` parameter lets you specify the font to be used for the console's text. You can provide a font family and size to create the desired appearance.

```python
console = Console(root, font=("Arial", 12))
```

## Background and Foreground Colors

You can customize the background and foreground colors of the console using the background and foreground parameters.

```python
console = Console(root, background="#232627", foreground="#FFFFFF")
```

Feel free to experiment with different font families, sizes, background colors, and foreground colors to create a console that matches your application's design.
